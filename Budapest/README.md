Nice — here’s a tight, practical **2.5-day Budapest plan** that fits your *Top-15* hits while **skipping time-heavy interiors/museums**. I assume you arrive **~12:35 Day 0**, clear airport, and can start exploring ~15:00. If your arrival is later or you feel jet-lagged, trim Day-0 slightly.

I give (A) a high-level plan per half/full day, (B) a timed walkable schedule you can follow, and (C) quick tips (tickets, transport, priorities). Let’s go.

# 1) Core idea — what to prioritize

Must-do highlights (high impact, low effort):

* Fisherman’s Bastion (views & photos)
* Buda Castle grounds (exterior + views)
* Danube Promenade & Shoes on the Danube (iconic, quick)
* Chain Bridge (walk across at least once)
* St. Stephen’s Basilica (exterior + rooftop for view if you want short visit)
* Széchenyi OR Gellért Thermal Bath (one major soak — pick one)
* Central Market Hall (food + gifts)
* Danube cruise (sunset or evening)
* Gellért Hill (sunset view / Liberty Statue)
* Ruin bar (Szimpla) for one relaxed evening

Nice extras if time: Parliament exterior photos, Matthias Church (exterior), Heroes’ Square (quick photo), Great Synagogue area walk.

# 2) 2.5-day schedule (fast, actionable)

## Day 0 — Arrival afternoon & evening (≈ half day)

**15:00–16:30** — Hotel check-in, quick freshen-up.
**16:30–17:30** — **St. Stephen’s Basilica** exterior + Vörösmarty / Basilica Christmas market (grab hot snack).
**17:30–18:15** — Walk Váci utca → **Danube Promenade** → **Shoes on the Danube** (photos).
**18:15–19:00** — Walk Chain Bridge (cross to Buda).
**19:00–20:00** — **Fisherman’s Bastion** at dusk (great light) + quick photos of **Buda Castle** (grounds).
**20:15–21:45** — **Thermal bath** (Rudas has great evening hours & rooftop; Gellért is beautiful Art Nouveau) — soak & unwind.
**22:00** — Light dinner / early night or optional ruin-bar (short visit to Szimpla if you have energy).

> Why: light, scenic first day; thermal bath restores jetlag.

## Day 1 — Full day (hit the big ones)

**08:30–10:30** — **Széchenyi Thermal Bath** (if you didn’t do Gellért) — morning is less crowded.
**10:45–11:00** — Walk to **Heroes’ Square** (photo 10–15 min).
**11:15–12:00** — Quick tram/metro to **Central Market Hall** → lunch (local food, paprika stalls, souvenirs).
**12:45–13:30** — Walk to **Parliament** (exterior photos from Kossuth Lajos Square / riverbank).
**13:30–15:00** — **Danube Promenade** southwards → stop at Shoes on the Danube again if you want different light + photo spots.
**15:00–16:30** — Cross Chain Bridge → **Buda Castle** grounds + **Matthias Church** exterior photos (no interior).
**16:45–17:30** — **Fisherman’s Bastion** for late-afternoon views.
**17:45–18:30** — Take a short taxi/ride to **Gellért Hill** for sunset & Liberty Statue views (if you didn’t already do Gellért baths).
**19:30–21:30** — **Evening Danube cruise** (sunset/dinner cruise if you want) OR revisit favourite market + dinner.
**22:00** — Optional **ruin bar** for a nightcap (Szimpla Kert).

> Why: this sequence keeps you moving along river then across to Buda — you get top views, markets, and the thermal experience.

## Day 2 — Half day (wrap & optional extras) — 0.5 day

**07:30–09:00** — Early coffee near hotel + quick walk to any missed spots (e.g., Central Market Hall if you skipped lunch there).
**09:15–10:00** — **Great Synagogue area** walk (Dohány Street) & Jewish Quarter cafés (no museum time).
**10:15–11:00** — Last-minute shopping or revisit a favourite viewpoint (Chain Bridge/Promenade).
**11:30+** — Head back to hotel, collect luggage, and continue onward.

> If you have a late departure: swap the morning for a museum/Parliament interior tour (book ahead) or a longer river cruise.

# 3) Fast map of attractions by cluster (helps planning walking legs)

* **Pest riverside cluster (walkable)**: St. Stephen’s Basilica → Vörösmarty Sq → Váci utca → Danube Promenade → Parliament (exterior) → Shoes on the Danube.
* **Heroes’ Square / City Park cluster**: Széchenyi Baths → Heroes’ Square → Andrássy Avenue (tram M1)
* **Buda cluster** (across Chain Bridge): Buda Castle grounds → Fisherman’s Bastion → Matthias Church → Gellért Hill & Gellért Baths (south of Buda)
* **Jewish Quarter**: Great Synagogue area, cafés, ruin bars (nightlife)

# 4) Practical logistics & booking notes

* **Thermal baths:** pre-book tickets (Széchenyi and Gellért often have timed entries). Bring swimsuit, flip-flops.
* **Danube cruise:** pre-book sunset/early-evening slot to secure seats (winter evenings are popular).
* **Parliament:** interior tours require booking. Since you’re skipping interiors, plan **exterior photos only** — best viewpoint is from the riverbank / Kossuth Square or from opposite Margit Island side.
* **Transport:** buy a 48-hour public transport pass if you’ll use metros/trams a lot; otherwise short taxis or Bolt are cheap. Tram 2 along the Danube is scenic.
* **Walking:** comfortable boots — winter streets can be slippery. Aim to group sights by cluster to minimize transit.
* **Timing buffer:** give 15–30 min slack between major spots for photos, coffee, restroom, and getting across bridges.
* **Weather:** cold/windy by the Danube — plan warm layers + hat/gloves.

# 5) What to skip to save time (recommended)

Skip long interior visits that eat 1–2 hours each:

* Hungarian Parliament interior tour (skip unless you **really** want it)
* Museum interiors at Castle or City Park (you’ll do exteriors/photo stops only)
* Full synagogue museum & Jewish Museum (instead do an exterior walk around Dohány St.)

# 6) Quick timing summary (one-line)

* **Day 0 (half):** Basilica → Danube Promenade → Chain Bridge → Fisherman’s Bastion → Thermal bath.
* **Day 1 (full):** Széchenyi bath → Heroes’ Square → Central Market Hall (lunch) → Parliament exterior → Buda Castle + Fisherman’s Bastion → Gellért Hill sunset → Danube cruise or ruin bar.
* **Day 2 (half):** Jewish Quarter cafés / last shopping → depart.

If you want, I’ll now:

* Turn this into a **printable one-page checklist** for your pocket, or
* Generate a **Google Calendar** friendly timetable (you paste times into your calendar), or
* Mark specific **addresses + recommended cafés & restaurant names** for each block (so you can walk straight there).

Which of these should I produce next?
